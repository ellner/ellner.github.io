This Zip archive contains the software files and documentation associated
with the paper "Fitting population dynamic models to time series data by 
gradient matching" by Stephen P. Ellner, Yodit Seifu1, and Robert H. Smith,
published in Ecology. The files are: 

Readme.txt -- this file
GradFuncs.R -- R source code for the fitting functions. Requires the MASS and 
		quadprog libraries. 
TestGradFuncs.R -- examples of using the main functions. Requires the mgcv library.
GradFuncs.doc, GRADFuncs.pdf -- documentation in MS Word and Adobe PDF formats.
NichAdults.txt -- data file used in TestGRADfuncs.R. The examples assume that this
	file is sitting in c:\\gradfuncs. If you put it anywhere else you'll need
	to edit the examples appropriately.
